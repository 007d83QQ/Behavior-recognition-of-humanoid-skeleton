# Behavior recognition of humanoid skeleton
This research focuses on the recognition of body movements. First, the key points of the body's trunk and limbs will be captured for calculation, and machine learning technology will be used to train and learn the positions of the key points of several postures. Finally, after using real images to obtain the key points of the human skeleton, the computer can automatically recognize the human body posture. In the preliminary experiments of this study, a high proportion of successful identifications have been obtained, which also proves that this method of identifying body behavior is highly feasible.    

In the future, we will expand the types of posture training for the computer to learn, and gradually be able to automatically capture the key points of the human skeleton in real images for automatic recognition.
